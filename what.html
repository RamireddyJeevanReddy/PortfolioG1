            <img id="img1" src="webdev.png">
            <p>This is the fun part where I get to build things that people love. I thrive on designing both the user
                experience (UX) and the backend, ensuring that every interaction is seamless and every system is robust.
                The creative process of crafting intuitive interfaces and powerful backend solutions is incredibly
                fulfilling. I also have a passion for experimenting with the latest technologies, constantly exploring
                new tools and frameworks to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. This blend of design and innovation
                allows me to create engaging, high-quality products that resonate with users and meet their needs in
                exciting new ways.
