    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <img src="photo.JPG" alt="">
    <p>I'm a passionate 3rd-year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, where I've been cultivating my love for
        technology and innovation. With a solid foundation in Java, full-stack development, SQL, and AWS cloud
        technology, I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of tech. I thrive on turning
        ideas into reality through small-scale projects, where I apply my knowledge and creativity to solve real-world
        problems. My journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a dedication to staying at the
        forefront of emerging technologies, and an unwavering commitment to making a positive impact through technology.
        As I continue my academic journey, I'm excited to see where my passion for technology will lead me next.</p>
